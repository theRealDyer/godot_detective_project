# Godot detective project

## This is the first repo for an attemp at making a detective-style, top-down, video game using Godot (4).

* Clone the repo. Keep it up to date with your commits and pushes so that the latest working version is available often.

* Please clone off of `dev` so that you are commiting and pushing back to `dev` and any merge conflicts are resolved at that level, before a working complete version gets push up to `main`.

Love,

James
